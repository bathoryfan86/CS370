For Project 2 I created a code that models a treasure hunting game that follows a loop sequence. This allows the user to explore and exploit the program to their advantage. 

Computer Scientists work on problem solving based on the use of algorithm data available to them. They design, code, test, and maintain software applications and systems that match the users specifications. 

A computer scientist should adopt a mindset that is analytical, curious, and methodical. Asking the question of Why? and developing a hypothesis to figure out the root cause of the problem is critical. Goal setting and analyzing probelms can help provide further solutions to the any of the problems at hand. 

With coding it is best to be upfront and as transparent as possible when dealing with challenges. If a users data is compromised due to a code exploitation then that would seriously derail any trust between the programmer and user.
